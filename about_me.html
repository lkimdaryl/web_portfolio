                        Hey there. Thank you for taking the time to know me.
                        My name is Kim Lim. I'm an aspiring software and web developer,
                        and a rising senior student at University of California San Diego.
                        Go Tritons!

                    <p>
                        Since high school, I have been exposed to the world of computer science.
                        I've been learning to code since I was 17 and had taken some programming classes
                        since then. I was able to finish high school strong and got my diploma as recognition
                        for my excellence.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>
                        After high school, I decided to go to a community college first since my family
                        was having a financial struggle. I didn't let that stop me and was able to finish
                        strong and got my Associates Degree in Computer Science for transfer. I transferred
                        to UCSD as a rising junior majoring in Computer Science and with two years of college
                        credits under my belt.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>
                        And now, as an upcoming senior, I plan to gain experience in my field of study.
                        I am passionate about technology, and have really enjoyed working on projects and
                        tech assignments thus far, especially with teams. I find it fulfilling to do what
                        I am doing now, and I intend to continue doing so in a professional environment.
